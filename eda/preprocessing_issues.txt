1. Loading Columns with Mixed data types
    - These columns need to be converted to datatype category
    OFN_LABEL        object
    INC_RELATEDTO    object
    conform          object
    OFF_CRIMEFREE    object
    DOB2             object
    MS_OFFBODY       object
    MS_SENTJP        object
    JP_CC_BUG        object
    ofn_label        object

2. Replacement of Categorical Variables with numeric values
    -We can take out this step entirely     

3. Missing Values Analysis. There are several variables that are problematic due to a large percentage of missing values 

    PCS_OFF_ID (PCS created ID variable for each unique person) is missing for 34%  of the rows

    ofn_label (description of the offense)		89.664702 % of the rows have Missing Values
    OFF_CRIMEFREE 88.48% (Offender crime free between 18 and 28 years of age (Used for determining lapsing for PRS.))
    OFF_AGE 69.12 %(Offender age (years) (Entered by county, if DOB is unavailable.)

    Couple of really important variables related to Incaceration is missing 
    INC_END	1466176	56.529752
	INC_START	1466176	56.529752
	INC_TYPE	1465901	56.519149

PCS created ID variable for each unique person (PCS_OFF_ID)
PCS_OFF_ID	899300	34.673331

4. OFN_LABEL vs ofn_label
There are some rows missing in OFN_LABEL vs some rows in ofn_label, and these two rows will need to be combined to create a single offense label


5. Need to Remove or account for Murder Charges in the Dataset 
There are Judicial Preceding that correspond to H-1=Murder 1;
H-2=Murder 2 charges. We need to decide on how to account for these 

6. Issue with Imputing SGR_LEVEL (Sentencing guideline level)
    -Need to explore further what '~' means before replacing it as missing

7. Date Related Issues 
    - How to Account for Errenous Date Values - the max date values
    df[['INC_START','dob','INC_START','IP_END','dos','dof']].max()
    INC_START   2071-12-28
    dob         2071-12-31
    INC_START   2071-12-28
    IP_END      2060-01-01
    dos         2019-12-31
    dof         2020-05-08
    dtype: datetime64[ns]
    - Issues with DOB
    e.g 
    JPO_ID	dob
	938145	2063-07-24
	971901	2064-01-24
	870391	2060-09-13
